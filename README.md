# image-resize
Augmentor in Python is my favourite library to play with images. This code is for resizing the image(s) in a folder and renaming them.
One important thing to remember is that after the resized images are stored in "output" folder, you cannot run the resize code again unless you remove that folder from the folder containing all images. I always cut and paste the output folder elsewhere before running the code again on those images.
